So after several long months here I am at the goal line... the Final Project... Is it right? Does it meet the requirements? After all this time and effort have I finally reached the end? 

This program has been absolutely fantastic. After taking a 20 year hiatus from programming, I did not fully appreciate or understand how much this art has changed. When I made the decision a little over year ago to jump back in to coding i truly thought that in just a few months i could get up to speed and launch the next facebook. Sure technology had advanced but how much could coding have changed since my days woring in basic, perl, cobol and pascal.... Surely i would be able to just read a book or two and get up to speed.

Well after several months of research and reading I quickly came to realize that the coding world had not only left me behind, but it left me in the stone ages!! Not to worry, the resources that have become available were amazing. With a little effort and time I realized that I could still achive my coding goals. After several weeks of research I found the Flatiron Online Bootcamp. This program has been perfect, exactly what I needed to grasp the new landscape of software development. 

I know that even after these last few months of learning that I will have to keep reading, studying and adapting to the rapidly changing landscape fo web development today. Flatiron has made me aware of the vast resources and the immense size that this proffession has become. I'm excited at the opportunity ahead of me and I am looking forward to the many projects ahead of me...
