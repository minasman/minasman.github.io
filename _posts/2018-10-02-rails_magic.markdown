So, I'm finally wrapping up my Rails project. I don't know why but this project seemed to drag on for too long. I've been reading everywhere about the magic of Rails and how wonderful it is, however I just don't see it. While I will admit that some challenges seem to be overcome easily, I think I prefer working in Sinatra. When I was working on my Sinatra project, the code seemed to flow almost effortlessly. I cannot say the same for these last two weeks that I have been working on my Rails project. Yes it has been at least two weeks. I originally planned to go through it in a few days, but between life issues and work issues, I have not had very much time to focus on programming. 
This project was similar to my Sinatra project. I created an application to create and track guest feedback for our restaurants. The application is set up to expand to allow access to features based on user access levels. Features to add in the future include the ability to add, edit or remove stores, the ability to report comments and updates, by store, user, guest, etc. This is hopefully part of a much bigger project I am working to put together as I go through this course. 
I will update everyone on the progress of my side project as I continue to the end of the course.
