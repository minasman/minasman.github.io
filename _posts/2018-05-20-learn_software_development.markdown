So, my story is not much different from most of the people here. I got my first taste of programming at an early age on a Radio Shack Tandy Color Computer 3 or CoCo3 as I knew it then. I started learning BASIC. From there I was hooked, but it wasn't until I got to college that I was able to continue building on my knowledge. I learned Pascal and some C. 

Unfortunately, life got in the way and my path turned to business and my coding journey abruptly ended. Over the last 20 or so years, I have dabbled in coding either through Visual Basic, HTML, CSS and other similar languages.  Most of the time because I was trying to automate some task or make something easier to do. 

Fast forward to today, in the last year to my delight, my daughter expressed an interest in learning how to program. With this we both jumped in and found a wealth of support on the internet. As we learned about all of the latest and greatest technologies available and the state of programming today, I was hooked again!!

Since then I've been buying books and crawling websites to learn as much as I can. I decided that I wanted to take a formal class or program to accelerate my learning. So here I am at Flatiron Online Web Developer program.
