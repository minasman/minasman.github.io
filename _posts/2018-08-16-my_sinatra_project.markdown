I'm sure this will sound pretty familiar to most of you: When should you stop adding "features" or customization to your project? I have been working on my Sinatra project and I must admit I am pretty proud of myself. Although I have technically met all of the specs for the project, I keep on thinking, "Wouldn't it be nice if the app would do this? Or, show this information? Or, allow the user to do that?" etc, etc. 
So down the rabbit hole I go…. Each new idea either helps to reinforce my understanding of Sinatra and Ruby or takes me to something new to learn about. Either way, it’s always a new challenge. 
For this project I wanted to try and build something that I could eventually turn into an application to use at work. We operate several restaurants throughout the city and like most businesses we always have maintenance issues popping up. The system that we currently use to create, update and track our work orders right now is a combination of off the shelf software, manual labor and spreadsheets – ITS EXTREMELY INEFFICIENT!!! These inefficiencies create unnecessary stress and confusion for the restaurants and maintenance staff. 
	My project is a good first step at a custom solution for managing the work orders that we generate. Users are able to create, update and review workorders and restaurants. Restaurant lists can be viewed along with a quick update of how many open or closed work orders they have. As I said this is a first step, the criteria for the project is complete, but when I submit my project, I am going to keep working on it to make it a more robust and functional application that can be implemented where I work.
