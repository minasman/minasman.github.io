Well here I am on the verge of finishing this step along my journey to become a web developer. I restarted this journey a little later than most of the people that I have encountered so far. I am not looking to make a career change, at least not right now. I started this to develop tools to make routine tasks easier for me and my teams. I have a passion for solving problems, efficiency and technology. I know that our organization could operate much more efficently and spend less time on admin issue and follow-up. This would give our team more time to focus on what's important, our guests.

To this end, I am looking to utilize the skills that I have learned through this program to develop tools and resources to allow our teams refocus their time and energy. 

I think what I have learned most is how to learn. Specifically when it comes to developing on the web. The last time I looked at this information was in the late 90's and the landscape of coding has changed tremendously. My eyes have opened to not only to possibilites available but also to the numerous tools and resources that are out there. 

I am looking forward to the road ahead.  Thanks to the team at Flatiron for making this a great experience!
