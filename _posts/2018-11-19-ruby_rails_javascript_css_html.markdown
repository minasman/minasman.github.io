Well I am almost done with my Rails and Javascript Project. This one has been challenging for a much different reason than the previous projects. I've been struggling alot with a few things:

* Focus on one issue at a time
* Language Focus
* Push, Commit - OFTEN

**Focus on one issue at a time**
Since the beginning of the bootcamp I've had a vision of the web application I want to develop. Each project gets me closer to realizing that goal. However, as I am working on an issue, my mind wanders back to the full vision of the application and I jump to a separate feature that I would like to include. In doing so, I lose my train of thought on the solution to the initial issue I was working on. Its very exciting to see it all come together and in that excitement I can't help but see the final application in use. 
I've started to keep a journal by me when I am coding to capture the thoughts and ideas as they occur, most of the time this works. Its still a work in progress.

**Language Focus**
One of the most challenging issues I am beginning to encounter is the ability to jump back and forth from Ruby to Javascript to HTML to CSS etc... It's sort of connected to the previous issue. As I am working on the view for a page and working in Ruby, I see something on the page that doesn't look perfect - so I jump to the CSS. As I am trying to remember how to use CSS to make the view look perfect I realize that there should be a section that should be responsive - so now jump to the the javascript. Now working on the Javascript I realize that I need to add a new section of HTML for the Javascript to do its thing... Each time I jump i'm usually spending 5-10 minutes googling for tips or looking for the resource on the specific syntax of what I am trying to do. 
I think the only way to overcome this is just to keep coding. With practice and time the muscle memory will kick in and it should get easier...right? 

**Push, Commit - OFTEN**
This is probably my biggest opportunity. I know that I should be committing to git as recommended, but as i get focused on an issue i'll look up and an hour has passed. I've written and deleted several lines of code, jumped to about 3-8 different files before I remember that I should commit my work. I beat myself up for 10 seconds and promise myself that I will commit more often. An hour later I repeat the process...
I'm still working on this issue. I've tried setting timers to remind me but I work right through the alarm. I know that there are several solutions out there so I will continue to find something that works for me.

So with all of this, my project is coming together and should be ready to submit in the next day or so. 
Happy Thanksgiving!!
